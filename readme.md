Asteroids

This is a retro-style remake of the 1979 Atari arcade classic, Asteroids.
It includes a healthy chunk of awesome technical features, including:

- A physics engine and aiming subroutines!
- Object-oriented game entities and prototypal inheritance!
- A Rails-powered high scores back-end!
- A JavaScript custom-written view-based user interface!
- HTML Canvas vector graphics and animation!
- Use of a sweet custom font through CSS!
- A JS-powered image and sound preloader!

And if you're not really into those, I guess there's some gameplay and stuff in there, too...

- Randomly spawning saucers!
- Collapsing asteroids with semi-conserved momentum! (sorry Physics majors)
- Particle effects!
- Explosions! Thrusters! Lasers!

Feel free to clone or hop onto the Heroku host. High score cheaters welcome and likely to be cleared once a month ;)

Cheers,
Polaris
